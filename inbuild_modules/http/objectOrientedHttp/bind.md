bind(this)

The .bind(this) part is critical in ensuring that the correct context (this) is used inside the handleRequest method.

    In JavaScript, the value of this is determined by how a function is called. When a method is called as a callback (like when the server receives a request), this might not refer to the instance of MyHttpServer anymore. Instead, it could refer to the global object (or undefined in strict mode), leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

    By using bind(this), we are creating a new function that, when called, has this set to the instance of MyHttpServer. This ensures that:
        When handleRequest is executed, it retains access to the instanceâ€™s properties and methods, including this.routes, which stores the defined routes.
